<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive portfolio website for Shrashti Singhal (an AI engineer/data scientist) from initial requirements to multiple design iterations and deployment attempts. Initially, a mock frontend was created with a teal color scheme, professional photo, and basic navigation. The user then requested a significant redesign to incorporate modern aesthetics like glass morphism, 3D/Isometric UI, Neo-Brutalism, Dark Mode with Neon Accents, and a smaller profile picture, along with content updates (15 projects, Amazon/Medium links, specific project images). The engineer implemented these, addressing feedback on shadow intensity and AVAILABLE FOR HIRE text. Subsequent work focused on GitHub Pages deployment, encountering and resolving several workflow/dependency issues, particularly related to  paths and React 19 compatibility. The final phase involved tackling mobile responsiveness problems in the projects section and non-functional LinkedIn URLs, which is the current ongoing task.

<product_requirements>
The user, Shrashti Singhal, an AI engineer and data scientist, requested a professional portfolio website. Initial requirements included a professional image, connect with me on LinkedIn CTA, and interactive card views for projects. The first iteration featured a teal color scheme.

Subsequently, a major redesign was requested:
- **Theme**: Orange neon theme with dark mode accents, glass morphism, 3D & Isometric UI, Neo-Brutalism, and Augmented Reality/Motion UI.
- **Imagery**: Smaller, passport-sized profile picture. Specific images for Nighthawk project (darkeye_mascot.png) and a relevant image for Healthcare Threat Detection System (monitoring IoT/IoMT for PII).
- **Content**: Display exactly 15 Major Projects (not 15+). Add links to Amazon book () and Medium profile () in a Publication and Recognition section.
- **Text**: Change AVAILABLE FOR HIRE to AVAILABLE FOR CONSULTANCY.
- **Deployment**: Host on GitHub Pages with a custom domain . This included fixing GitHub Actions workflow errors, dependency conflicts (React 19 with react-day-picker), and  path issues.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fix non-rendering/stuck projects section on mobile, address an overlapping header issue on mobile, and fix non-functional LinkedIn URLs.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Styling & UI**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, modern design trends (Glass morphism, Neo-Brutalism, 3D/Isometric UI, Dark Mode with Neon Accents).
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions (CI/CD workflows).
- **State Management**: React Context (implicitly for Toast).
- **Package Management**: Yarn (frontend), Pip (backend).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main entry point for the React application, handling routing with  and initiating a Hello World API call to the backend. It uses  for API calls.
    -   *Changes*: Initial setup, later integrated custom components, updated for design changes and content.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Hero.js**: Displays the user's name, role, profile picture, and key statistics. It's the first section visitors see.
    -   *Changes*: Significant redesigns (teal -> dark mode with neon accents, glass morphism), photo resizing, AVAILABLE FOR HIRE text changed to AVAILABLE FOR CONSULTANCY, and fixing name/tag overlap.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Projects.js**: Displays the user's projects in interactive card views, including images and project details.
    -   *Changes*: Updated to show exactly 15 projects, added Nighthawk and Healthcare Threat Detection System images, implemented mobile responsiveness fixes for layout and filtering.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Contact.js**: Provides contact information and a call to action.
    -   *Changes*: Adapted to the dark theme, included Amazon book and Medium profile links.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Header.js & Footer.js**: Provide site-wide navigation and persistent information.
    -   *Changes*: Adapted to the dark theme, navigation links updated, LinkedIn CTA.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css, index.css, tailwind.config.js**: Core styling files, defining the overall look and feel of the application, including custom animations and the dark mode color palette.
    -   *Changes*: Extensive modifications to implement neon accents, glass morphism, shadow adjustments, and dark mode.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json & yarn.lock**: Manage frontend dependencies.
    -   *Changes*: Updated to resolve React 19 compatibility issues with  and , ensuring proper build.
-   **/.github/workflows/**: Contains GitHub Actions YAML files (, , , , ) for automated deployment to GitHub Pages.
    -   *Changes*: Multiple iterations to fix  path issues and ensure robust deployment across different repository structures.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: The FastAPI backend providing a basic  endpoint and  endpoints (though not extensively used or integrated into the current frontend).
    -   *Changes*: No significant changes were made to the backend during this trajectory, focusing mainly on the frontend and deployment.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the mobile responsiveness of the Project section, which currently renders as a long empty scroll and gets stuck upon interaction.
- Address an overlapping issue at the top of the mobile view (header/hero section).
- Ensure the LinkedIn URL works correctly at all two places it is implemented on the website.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the process of resolving several critical mobile responsiveness and functionality issues. Specifically, the user reported that the entire Projects section was not rendering correctly on mobile devices; it displayed a long empty scroll, and clicking anywhere on the empty space would cause the projects to render, but then the entire website would become unresponsive. Additionally, there was an overlapping issue at the top of the mobile view, likely affecting the header or hero section. Finally, the LinkedIn URL implemented in two places on the website was not functional.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer acknowledged these issues, analyzing user-provided screenshots, and stated the intention to start examining the codebase to identify and resolve these problems. The previous work successfully addressed significant design overhauls, content updates (15 projects, Amazon/Medium links, specific project images), and multiple deployment workflow fixes, but these mobile-specific and link functionality bugs remain.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Examine the codebase for the Projects component to fix mobile rendering and investigate non-functional LinkedIn URLs.
