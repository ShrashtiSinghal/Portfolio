# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for shrashti.com

Your portfolio is now ready for deployment! Follow these steps to get your stunning AI portfolio live on shrashti.com.

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

All files are ready and configured:
- ✅ `package.json` updated with homepage URL
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow created
- ✅ CNAME file configured for custom domain
- ✅ SEO meta tags added
- ✅ Build process tested and working
- ✅ gh-pages package installed

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Push to GitHub Repository

```bash
# If you haven't already pushed to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "✨ Add futuristic AI portfolio with GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Repository Settings

1. **Go to your GitHub repository** (where you pushed the code)
2. **Navigate to Settings** → **Pages**
3. **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
4. **Custom domain**: Enter `shrashti.com` (this should auto-populate from CNAME file)

### 3. Configure Domain DNS Settings

In your domain registrar (where you bought shrashti.com), add these DNS records:

**A Records** (for apex domain):
```
@ (or shrashti.com)  →  185.199.108.153
@ (or shrashti.com)  →  185.199.109.153
@ (or shrashti.com)  →  185.199.110.153
@ (or shrashti.com)  →  185.199.111.153
```

**CNAME Record** (for www subdomain):
```
www  →  shrashti.com
```

### 4. Wait for Deployment

- **GitHub Actions**: Will automatically trigger on push to main branch
- **Build time**: ~2-3 minutes
- **DNS propagation**: 5-60 minutes
- **SSL certificate**: Auto-generated by GitHub (may take up to 24 hours)

## 📊 Monitor Deployment Status

### Check GitHub Actions
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Green checkmark = successful deployment
4. Red X = build failed (check logs)

### Verify Domain Setup
```bash
# Check DNS propagation
nslookup shrashti.com

# Expected response should show GitHub Pages IPs
```

## 🔧 Alternative: Manual Deployment (Backup Method)

If GitHub Actions fails, you can deploy manually:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# 2. Install gh-pages if not already installed
yarn add --dev gh-pages

# 3. Build and deploy
yarn build
yarn deploy
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**❌ Build fails in GitHub Actions**
- Check the workflow logs in Actions tab
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in package.json
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

**❌ Domain not working after 24 hours**
- Double-check DNS records with your domain provider
- Ensure CNAME file contains only: `shrashti.com`
- Try clearing browser cache or use incognito mode

**❌ CSS/JS not loading**
- Verify `"homepage": "https://shrashti.com"` in package.json
- Check if build process completed successfully

**❌ 404 errors on page refresh**
- GitHub Pages serves SPAs correctly, but if issues persist
- Add a 404.html file that redirects to index.html

### Getting Help

1. **Check repository Actions tab** for build logs
2. **GitHub Pages Status**: https://www.githubstatus.com/
3. **DNS Checker**: https://dnschecker.org/

## 🎉 Post-Deployment Verification

Once deployed, verify these elements work:

- ✅ **Homepage loads** at https://shrashti.com

- ✅ **Links work** (LinkedIn, GitHub, Medium)
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** (test on phone/tablet)
- ✅ **SEO tags** (check page source for meta tags)

## 📈 Performance Optimization (Optional)

After deployment, you can further optimize:

1. **Add Google Analytics** (replace/update the existing tracking)
2. **Enable HTTPS** (auto-enabled by GitHub Pages)
3. **Add sitemap.xml** for better SEO
4. **Compress images** for faster loading

## 🔄 Future Updates

To update your portfolio:
